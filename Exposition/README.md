# Exposition

Quite frequently I've wanted to show people various fractals I've made and discovered. This usually translates into
showing them some pictures on my phone that I made 3 years ago, showing them google results, or building and
running a preview app with different equations and iteration methods.

Exposition is a showcase of fractals. Some are interactive, which allows you to see how the fractal changes over 
fields of complex numbers. There is a cursor which shows where in the complex plain the parameters is, click or
drag to adjust it's location.
